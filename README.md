# Energy Consumption Prediction

## Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict energy consumption. It involves preprocessing a dataset, training a polynomial regression model with cross-validation, and making predictions on test data. The aim is to provide insights into energy usage patterns.

## Project Structure
- `train.csv`: Training dataset.
- `test.csv`: Test dataset.
- `predictive_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code for preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- `predictions.csv`: Output file containing predictions for the test dataset.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Setup**:
   - Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.
   - Install dependencies: `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib`.

2. **Running the Project**:
   - Open and run `predictive_model.ipynb`.
   - Place `train.csv` and `test.csv` in the project directory.
   - Predictions will be saved as `predictions.csv`.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

This project serves as a foundation for energy consumption forecasting and offers valuable insights into consumption patterns.
